# usl4j

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/codahale/usl4j.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/codahale/usl4j)

usl4j is Java modeler for [Dr. Neil Gunther][NJG]'s [Universal Scalability Law][USL], which can be
used in system testing and capacity planning, as described by [Baron Schwartz][BS] in his book
[Practical Scalability Analysis with the Universal Scalability Law][PSA]. The model coefficients and
predictions should be within 0.02% of those listed in the book.

## Add to your project

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.codahale</groupId>
  <artifactId>usl4j</artifactId>
  <version>0.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

It depends on [DDogleg Numerics][DDogleg] for least-squares regression.

## How to use this

As an example, consider doing load testing and capacity planning for an HTTP server. To model the
behavior of the system using the [USL][USL], you must first gather a set of measurements of the
system. These measurements must be of two of the three parameters of [Little's Law][LL]: mean
response time (in seconds), throughput (in requests per second), and concurrency (i.e. the number of
concurrent clients).

Because response time tends to be a property of load (i.e. it rises as throughput or concurrency
rises), the dependent variable in your tests should be mean response time. This leaves either
throughput or concurrency as your independent variable, but thanks to [Little's Law][LL] it doesn't
matter which one you use. For the purposes of discussion, let's say you measure throughput as a
function of the number of concurrent clients working at a fixed rate (e.g. you used
[`wrk2`][wrk2]).

After your load testing is done, your should have a set of measurements shaped like this:

|concurrency|throughput|
|-----------|----------|
|          1|      4227|
|          2|      8382|
|          4|     16479|
|          8|     31856|
|         16|     59564|
|         32|    104462|
|         64|    162985|

For simplicity's sake, let's assume you're storing this as a `double[][]`. Now you can build our
model and begin estimating things:

```java
import com.codahale.usl4j.Measurement;
import com.codahale.usl4j.Model;
import java.util.Arrays;

class Example {
  void buildModel() {
    final double[][] points = {{1, 4227}, {2, 8382}, {4, 16479}}; // etc.
  
    // Map the points to measurements of throughput and build a model. 
    final Model model = Arrays.stream(points)
                              .map(Measurement.ofConcurrency()::andThroughput)
                              .collect(Model.toModel());
    for (int i = 10; i < 200; i+=10) {
      System.out.printf("At %d workers, expect %f req/sec\n", i, model.throughputAtConcurrency(i));
    }
  }
}
```

## Further reading

I strongly recommend [Practical Scalability Analysis with the Universal Scalability Law][PSA], a
free e-book by [Baron Schwartz][BS], author of [High Performance MySQL][MySQL] and CEO of
[VividCortex][VC]. Trying to use this library without actually understanding the concepts behind
[Little's Law][LL], [Amdahl's Law][AL], and the [Universal Scalability Law][USL] will be difficult
and potentially misleading.
